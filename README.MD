# PyFy project

## 20024.08.17

This is part of an ongoing effort to review my personal finances with Python scripts. The code and samples here are purely for demonstration.

Currently, this version of the project, features two CSV files representing credit card statements. The programme combines the files into a single Data Frame, and from there generates a Matplotlib chart showing daily spending.
